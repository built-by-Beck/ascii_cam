# ASCII Camera

A real-time ASCII art generator built with Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. This project captures live video from your webcam, processes it, and displays it as ASCII art in an interactive, resizable GUI.

This project combines creativity with technical skills, transforming a simple webcam feed into dynamic ASCII art using all characters from the alphabet and symbols. It’s an impressive showcase of Python programming, computer vision, and GUI design.

## Features

- **Real-Time ASCII Art**: Transforms live video frames into ASCII art in real time.
- **Comprehensive Character Set**: Uses all letters (A-Z) along with standard symbols (`@%#*+=-:. `) for detailed rendering.
- **Resizable GUI**: Dynamically adjusts ASCII art resolution when you resize the window.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Tkinter, providing a responsive and user-friendly GUI.
- **Optimized Performance**: Smooth updates at ~30 FPS, ensuring minimal latency.

## Preview

Here’s an example of ASCII art generated by the project:

ABCD@@EFG@@HIJKLMNOPQRST@@@@UVWXY@ 
@@Z%%%%####@@@@@@@####@@@@@@#####@
@@ABCD@@@@@#############@@@@@@#### 
@@FGHIJKLMNOPQ@@@@@@@@@@@@####@@@@ 
@@RSTUVWXY@@@@@@##############@@@@


Imagine this updating in real time from your webcam feed!

## How It Works

1. **Frame Capture**: OpenCV captures video frames from your webcam.
2. **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts each frame into grayscale.
3. **ASCII Mapping**: Maps pixel intensity values to characters from the ASCII set (`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@%#*+=-:. `).
4. **Dynamic Rendering**: Displays the ASCII art in a resizable Tkinter GUI.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy pillow

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascii-camera.git
cd ascii-camera

Run the program:
python ascii_camera.py

Resize or maximize the window to adjust the ASCII art resolution dynamically.
To exit, close the window or press Ctrl+C.
Customization
Character Set: Modify the gscale_custom variable in the code to use your own set of ASCII characters.
Resolution: Change the default cols and scale values to control the detail and aspect ratio of the ASCII art.
GUI Appearance: Customize the Tkinter window’s background, font size, or text color.
Skills Demonstrated
Python Programming: Efficient use of OpenCV, Tkinter, and Numpy libraries.
Real-Time Processing: Implementation of a smooth, live video-to-ASCII pipeline.
GUI Development: Responsive design with dynamic resizing and font scaling.
Performance Optimization: Real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead.
Why This Project Matters
This project bridges art and technology, providing a creative way to display live video. It demonstrates:

Advanced knowledge of Python libraries.
The ability to handle real-time data processing.
An understanding of graphical user interface design.
