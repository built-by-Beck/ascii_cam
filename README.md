# ASCII Camera

**ASCII Camera** is a Python-based real-time video-to-ASCII art converter using OpenCV and Tkinter. This project captures live webcam video, processes it frame-by-frame, and transforms it into dynamic ASCII art displayed in a resizable GUI.

## Features

- **Real-Time ASCII Rendering**: Converts live video into ASCII art with smooth updates (~30 FPS).
- **Dynamic GUI**: The Tkinter interface adjusts resolution when the window is resized.
- **Customizable Character Sets**: Uses all letters (A-Z) and symbols like `@%#*+=-:. ` for detailed ASCII rendering.
- **Efficient Design**: Optimized for real-time performance with minimal latency.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascii-camera.git
   cd ascii-camera
